    <h2>How the data was analyzed by ClearTerms:</h2>
    <p>Our method for analyzing websites uses a machine learning model that we built.
        This model is based on crowdsourced surveys that we conducted to capture people's
        opinion on various privacy statements. You can see more information about the logistics in the <%= link_to 'Frequently Asked Questions Page', faq_path %>.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How does this work?</h2>
    <p> ClearTerms chooses these terms via a machine learning algorithm based on crowdsourcing. <br> <br> Hundreds of people identified 
        terms they thought were important; their opinions were tested for consistency and then used to train the model. </p>
